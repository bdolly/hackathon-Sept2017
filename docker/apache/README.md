Disclaimer:

At this time, the httpd-vhosts.conf is configured to point to my(namdets) local docker-machine and my local IRCT dev instance.

The ServerName and ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives will need to be modified to match your local environment before you build this project.

These hacks will be resolved at a later date.
